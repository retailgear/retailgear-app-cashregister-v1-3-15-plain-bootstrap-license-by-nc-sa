How can I go for commercial use?
We offer our full eco-system for commercial use. To upgrade: Login in to our admin portal via retailgear.com. We offer a well designed ('Metronic8' theme: https://keenthemes.com/metronic/), a much more extended version of our frontend for just 80 euro one time payment. So you'll get access to almost our whole micro-world of retailgear.com including 80+ extra features to fully manage your retailstore, retail-chain or to refactor an existing cash register software! When you log in to the admin panel of retailgear.com and make a purchase you'll get this full code with a license for commercial use. Find the Non-commercial License in this repo for more info.
